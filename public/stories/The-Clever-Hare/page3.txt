The day of the race arrived. The track was set through a winding path that sparkled with dewdrops and was shaded by the large leafy canopy of the forest. As the race began, Hazel dashed forward. Midway through the race, she saw Truman far behind, moving steadily but slowly. Hazel decided to play a trick. She pretended to take a rest under a large oak, counting on Truman's nature to keep a constant pace.

Sure enough, Truman passed Hazel, thought she was taking a break, and moved on with a steady plod. Hazel waited until Truman was just a bit ahead and then sprung forward again, dashing past him and crossing the finish line first. The crowd roared in celebration. King Lion gave Hazel the grand feast, which she graciously shared with Truman, as a sign of respect for his determination. Everyone in the forest cheered for the clever hare who won not just with speed, but with cleverness and heart.
